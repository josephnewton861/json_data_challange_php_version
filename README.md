# JSON data extraction challenge app

### Project Overview
##### This project is my attempt at a technical challenge that was presented to me. It involves analysing JSON file and extracting out the relevant data 
##### to then present it on a web page. The app is application is built using PHP and XAMPP (local server used for PHP projects), which before starting the project 
##### I had not encountered either before. Other technologies used include CSS, Bootstrap and HTML. The app is hosted using Heroku. 

### Getting Started

##### Feel free to clone the application using the command git clone on the following link: https://github.com/josephnewton861/json_data_challenge_php_version, 
##### however Do NOT fork the repository!

### Features
##### The app is a static web page which displays the title, image and title link from a JSON file which is entered around news reports.
##### The app has this information displayed in a card for an increased user experience and following this if the user feels they want to click on the link for more information they can do so.
